## History Sync

After connecting successfully, the socket will try to download and process old chats, contacts and messages.

This data is delivered to you via the messaging-history.set event. Here's an example on how to handle this data:

sock.ev.on('messaging-history.set', ({
chats: newChats,
contacts: newContacts,
messages: newMessages,
syncType
}) => {
// handle the chats, contacts and messages
})

You should store this data in your database and use it however you want. However, you should keep a record of messages so you can provide those messages to the getMessage function in the socket config.

Disabling History Sync
You can choose to disable or receive no history sync messages by setting the shouldSyncHistoryMessage option to () => false.

On-Demand History Sync
It is possible ask the main device for history data beyond the initial sync. This is done using the sock.fetchMessageHistory function.
